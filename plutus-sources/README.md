This directory is adapted from the Plutus examples in [cardano-node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node).  This version includes `plutus-helloworld` which instantiates the example with a different script (the `HelloWorld` script needed for the Exercises).

The original sources and further examples can be found in:

# plutus-example

This directory demonstates end-to-end examples of creating and executing Plutus scripts on chain.

This is done roughly in the following steps:

1. Write your Plutus **on chain** code.
2. Serialize your Plutus on chain code to the text envelope format (`cardano-cli` expects this format).
3. Create your transaction with the accompanying Plutus script(s).
4. Submit transaction to execute Plutus script.

# plutus-alwayssucceeds

This directory contains sources for a Plutus script that "always succeeds"

# plutus-helloworld

This directory contains a simple "Hello World" script.  There are two versions: one using an integer literal (needed because the Plutus interpreter doesn't currently accept byte string literals) and a slighly more complicated one using a bytestring parameter.

## FAQ

### Where is the off chain code?

The off chain code is used for transaction construction. In this case we construct the transaction with `cardano-cli` and therefore we don't need to write any off chain code.

### Where can I learn about Plutus scripts in more detail?

Our education director, Lars Br√ºnjes, has an excellent series of [tutorials](https://youtu.be/IEn6jUo-0vU) on youtube. We will not attempt to provide an indepth explanation of Plutus in this repository.
